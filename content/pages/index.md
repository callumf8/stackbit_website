      Hello world and welcome to my small corner of the internet! As a theoretical astrophysicist I like to spend my days thinking about the fluid dynamics governing a variety of systems - from the energetic flows around Active Galactic Nuclei to the spinning discs where extra-solar planets are born.

      I have just uptaken a postdoctoral membership at the Institute for Advanced Study where I am excited to pursue my research further and enjoy some adventures as a Scotsman abroad in the land of the free!
