      Hello world and welcome to my small corner of the internet! I'm a 3rd year
      PhD student working in DAMTP Cambridge where I am excited by distorted
      astrophysical discs! Outside of research, I've recently picked up kayaking
      and enjoy camping and exploring the countryside in my wee Fiat Panda. 6 ft
      2 in a compact...but luckily the seats go back.
